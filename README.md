# SIRE
SIRE is an infrastructure that supports remote attestation, application membership management, auditable integrity-protected logging and coordination primitives. This project was developed by the LaSIGE research unit at the University of Lisbon.

This package contains the source code (``\src``), dependencies (``\lib``), running scripts (``\runscripts``), and configuration files (``\config``).
SIRE requires Java 17.0.1 or later.


SIRE is composed by 4 entities:
- Server (``rep*`` folders)
- Proxy (``pro*`` folders)
- Device/Attester (``cli*`` folders)
- App Administrator (``man*`` folders)

#Quick Start
Before running SIRE, some configuration must be done regarding the location of each replica and proxy.

The servers address must be specified in the file ``config\hosts.config``:
```
#server id, address and port
0 127.0.0.1 11000 11001
1 127.0.0.1 11010 11011
2 127.0.0.1 11020 11021
3 127.0.0.1 11030 11031
```
The proxy address can be specified in the file ``config\proxy.properties``:
```
ip=127.0.0.1
port=2501
```
The port should be ``2500 + proxyId``, e.g., for port 2501, your proxy should have id 1.
This id can be specified when running the proxy, as will be shown later.

**Note:** This address is only used by the mock device provided. If you are using your own device, this can be disregarded.


# How to Compile
To compile, use the following command:
```
gradle localDeploy
```
If you do not have Gradle installed, you can obtain it here: https://gradle.org/install/.

This command will create a directory on your Desktop with the name "SIRE".
Inside there will be multiple folders corresponding to each one of SIRE's entities.
# How to Run
First, change your current directory according to what entity you want to run., e.g., to run server replica 0, you should change your directory to ``Desktop\SIRE\rep0``.  
Then, use the following command:  
(Command Line)
```
run.cmd [path to class]
```
(Terminal)
```
smartrun.sh [path to class]
```
List of paths for each entity:
- Server: ``sire.server.SireServer`` (Requires a number id as an argument, starting from 0. Configured for 4 replicas.)
- Proxy: ``sire.proxy.ProxyMain`` (Requires a number id as an argument and should match the port specified in the configuration file. Default configuration is for id 1.)
- Attester/Device: ``sire.device.DeviceClient``
- App Admin: ``sire.management.ManagementClient``

The existent client is a mock device that executes a variety of operations to demonstrate the usage of SIRE.

# How to Configure Applications
In this section, we will explain how to configure remote attestation policies and extensions for your own applications.

The following operations are available to app administrators:

Function | Description |
-------- | ----------- |
setPolicy(appId, policy) | Sets policy from app with id *appId* |
deletePolicy(appId) | Deletes policy from app with id *appId* |
getPolicy(appId) | Gets policy from app with id *appId* |
 |  |
addExtension(appId, type, key, code) | Adds extension for app with id *appId* to be executed when an operation of given type is called with the given key. The given type and key can be null. The code will be stored associated with extensionKey (appId + type + key, in this order).
removeExtension(appId, type, key) | Removes extension associated with extensionKey (appId + type + key, in this order). The given type/key can be null.
getExtension(appId, type, key) | Gets the code of the extension associated with extensionKey (appId + type + key). The given type/key can be null.

These operations can be accessed either through REST requests, through regular sockets or through a user-friendly web interface.
All these interfaces are made available through the proxy.

Both the policy and extensions must be implemented in Groovy.
In the case of the policy, the Groovy script should have a ``verifyEvidence`` method that takes an ``Evidence`` object as input
(see file ``attestation\Evidence.java``).
In the case of the extension, the script should have a ``runExtension`` method that takes an ``ExtParams`` object as input
(see file ``coordination\ExtParams.java``).

# How to Use
In this section, we will explain how to use SIRE with your own devices.

SIRE has the following operations available to devices:

Function | Description |
-------- | ----------- |
put(appId, deviceId, key, value) | Adds a new entry to storage |
delete(appId, deviceId, key) | Deletes an entry from storage |
getData(appId, deviceId, key) | Gets data associated with key from storage |
getList(appId, deviceId) | Gets list of all entries |
cas(appId, deviceId, key, oldValue, newValue) | If value of key is equal to oldValue, replaces it with newValue. |
 |  |
preJoin(appId, deviceId, pubKey, signature) | Start the attestation protocol |
join(appId, deviceId, pubKey, evidence, signature) | Finish the attestation protocol and join the applicationâ€™s membership |
leave(appId, deviceId) | Leave the system |
ping(appId, deviceId) | Assures the system that the device is still running |
getView(appId, deviceId) | Get current membership of application |

These operations can be accessed either through REST requests or through regular sockets.
Both interfaces are made available through the proxy.

## Sockets ##
Communication through sockets requires requests to be serialized with Protobuf, which can be compiled to a variety of
languages.
The structure of these requests (``ProxyMessage``) can be found in the file ``messages\messages.proto``, which also 
contains the structure of the responses (``ProxyResponse``) provided by SIRE.

## REST ##
Communication through REST can be done through the address defined for the proxy (``http:\\127.0.0.1:8080`` by default).
Each operation can be accessed as follows:

Function | Path |
-------- | ----------- |
put | PUT request on *sireaddress*/map?appId=*app* |
delete | DELETE request on *sireaddress*/map?appId=*app* |
getData | GET request on *sireaddress*/map?appId=*app* |
getList | GET request on *sireaddress*/mapList?appId=*app* |
cas | POST request on *sireaddress*/map?appId=*app* |
|  |
preJoin | POST request on *sireaddress*/member?appId=*app* |
join | PUT request on *sireaddress*/member?appId=*app* |
leave | DELETE request on *sireaddress*/member?appId=*app* |
ping | PUT request on *sireaddress*/ping?appId=*app* |
getView | GET request on *sireaddress*/view?appId=*app* |

The body of the requests should be in JSON format and all byte array values are expected to be encoded in Base64.
The format of the requests and responses can be found in the ``RESTRequests.java`` and ``RESTResponses.java``, respectively.
